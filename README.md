👋 Hi, I’m @mshilacodes

👀 I’m interested in Photography, Comics, Anime, Cosplay, and anything geeky

🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Cleaning, Data visualization (this list will grow), also looking to collab on topics/projects around Environment, Queer rights, Women rights and Anime.  

📫 How to reach me: 📨 mshaisonia@gmail.com

😄 Pronouns: she/her, they/them

⚡ Fun fact: I almost won a cosplay competition dressed as Bilbo Baggins (it wasn't a great cosplay), but the true prize was the friends I made along the way 😉🎉
